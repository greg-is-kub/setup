### LSP
To ease code navigation in helix, you can install LSP's. 

- **C++**
    - [clangd](https://github.com/clangd/clangd) C lang LSP
    - [bear](https://github.com/rizsotto/Bear) a tool that wraps make & generate `compile_commands.json` from a MakeFile
- **python**
    - [pylsp](https://github.com/python-lsp/python-lsp-server) : the old python lsp, written in python, slow as f
    - [pyrefly](https://pyrefly.org/) static type checker made by meta (we don't like meta but its the best as of now)
    - [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) python formatter written in rust by [astral](https://astral.sh/)
    - [ty](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) python type checker written in rust by [astral](https://astral.sh/) (beta, not really feature complete as of now)

> [!note] If you wish to add a new LSP support you are more than welcome to submit a pull request. 
> This would comprise :
> 1. Scripts to install the language's LSP.
> 2. Config for the helix editor in `./dotfiles/helix/.config/helix/languages.toml`.

# install

## pre-requisite
All pkg used here are not hosted by apt, you will need to install the `cargo`, `brew` & `uv` pkg managers.

```bash
./install/pkg_managers.sh # will install rust and cargo its pkg manager
```

## terminal setup and multiplexer

### Alacritty
```bash
# alacritty needed system libraries
apt install cmake pkg-config libfreetype6-dev libfontconfig1-dev libxcb-xfixes0-dev libxkbcommon-dev python3
cargo install alacritty
```

### Install nerd font
Use [nerd font installer](https://github.com/officialrajdeepsingh/nerd-fonts-installer) to install the font you want (go to official site to see their preview).
Then selected the terminal font in ~/.config/alacritty.toml in the section `[font]`:
> **TIP :** to see the exact font name, find your font using `fc-list` in bash.
```toml
[font]
style = "Regular"
size = 11.0

[font.normal]
family = "GohuFont 11 Nerd Font Mono"
style = "Regular"
```

### Zellij
```bash
cargo install --locked zellij
```
- [OPTIONNAL] copy my zellij .dotfile to your ~/.config/ folder to have my setup instead of the default one
```bash
cp ./dotfiles/zellij/ ~/.config/zellij
```

## installing the tools
Install scripts are split as of now. 
1. You need to install `rust` to use `cargo`, its package manager. Installing rust multiple times is useless.
2. `apt-get` needs `sudo` & `sudo cargo install` won't work properly.
3. instaling w/ cargo will install in $HOME so if you are in a docker w/ `$HOME` mounted you don't need to reinstall them. You only need to reinstall the apt pkg.You will only need to add them in your path with `.setup_dockerrc` that mainly adds stuff to the `$PATH` and creates aliases.

```bash
cd install/
sudo ./install_tools.sh # will install apt pkg
# no need to add cargo to your .bashrc for now this is in the next step
source "$HOME/.cargo/env"
./install_cargo_tools.sh # will install the cargo binaries
```

>! Warning : 
sccache cargo pkg has apt pkg deps : openssl & pkg config, they are installed in install-tools.sh hence you need to run these commands in this specific order.

### Helix : code editor
[Tutorial to install helix](https://docs.helix-editor.com/install.html)
> Note: you can also use my helix config, set it up using stow as just shown below

### Zellij plugins
They are voluntarily taken of the repo to keep it lightweight. List of plugins to install : 
- [rooms](https://github.com/rvcas/room)

### setup 
#### Copy .files using [stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/manual/stow.html#Introduction) 
Use [stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/manual/stow.html#Introduction) to create symlinks from `dotfiles/*` to your config files (mostly goes to ~/.config except for gdb) to configure the utils that need it.

> [!warning]
> A nerdfont is defined in the config file for alacritty. If you copy my config with `stow`, it will surely break your terminal view if not setup.
> Go to next step (install nerdfont) to solve it or modify the entry in `.config/alacritty.toml`.

```bash
apt install stow
```
```bash
cd
stow -d <path/to/this/repo>/dotfiles -t . <pkg_name>
```
with `pkg_name` being the names of the folders located in `./dotfiles`
 
2. **.append_bashrc** contains most of the setup you will need for installed tools, you just need to append it to your `.bashrc`
```bash
cat append_bashrc >> .bashrc
```
